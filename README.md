#UzaPoint Interview

## Description

The assessment task involves creating a "Contacts Manager App" that allows users to manage their contacts. You will be responsible for both the backend (Laravel) and the frontend (Flutter) development. The task is designed to evaluate your skills in web and mobile app development and your ability to work with RESTful APIs.


Task Details:

- Backend (Laravel):

  - Implement user authentication.

  - Develop contact management features, including creating, editing, deleting, and viewing contacts.

  - Enable users to organize contacts into lists or groups.

  - Implement RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, contact management, and contact lists.


- Frontend (Flutter):

  - Create a user-friendly UI for contact management.

  - Implement user authentication screens.

  - Allow users to view and manage their contacts and contact lists.

  - Include the ability to upload and change contact profile pictures.

  - Communicate with the Laravel backend through HTTP requests.


## Quick Start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **MVVM** (business logic component) [MvvM](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-mvvm-in-flutter-4b28b63da2ca) to separate the business logic with UI itself.

## Getting Started

1. Clone [Contacts api](https://github.com/collins-swai/contacts_api) to your machine
2.  Run **php artisan serve** in your terminal to get the server running and get something like this:

3. Install Ngrok in your laptop by running this command **brew install ngrok** 

4. Run the following command to make your local host link live **ngrok http http://localhost:8000**, where you will get this:

## How to run the App
1. Clone this project.
2. Open with your favorite tools editor.
3. Run `Pub get` on each module sequentially starting from `dependencies`, `core`, `shared`, and `your root project` to generated `pubspec.lock` file.
4. Add your `ngrok link` into ***Network Service*** class file. Under Network, which is in in the Data folder and replace the BASE_URL link
